# Concept
i like robots and ninjas (ilran)


## Gameplay loop
player spawns
enemy player picks 3 abilities for player
player can slot abilities into weapons
countdown starts
players fight
player looses/wins
repeats 3 times
scoreboard is shown
rating is applied
player leaves match


health reg per 0.5 sec is 2hp (delay after damage)
bullets do 5hp base damage
enhanced bullets do 10hp dmg
everything does a base damage of 15hp
when you combine stuff it makes 50% more damage
15hp + 15hp * 150% == 45hp
15hp + 15hp + 15hp * 150% = 70hp

2rd lvl permutation == opposites offensive/defensive
3rd lvl permutation == debuff/buff/materialisation

# game rules
round 1 = 1 point
round 2 = 2 points
